`Sequence based identifiers
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Sequence-based_identifiers>`_
are used for versioning (schema follows below):

- It's always safe to upgrade within the same minor version (for example, from
  0.3 to 0.3.4).
- Minor version changes might be backwards incompatible. Read the
  release notes carefully before upgrading (for example, when upgrading from
  0.3.4 to 0.4).

-----
2018-01-28

0.2.6
-----
2018-01-28

- Added ``OrderingFilter``, which makes it possible to specify
  mapping (ordering option -> ORM field) for making more developer
  friendly ordering options in the API. An example of such could be
  a ``Profile`` model with ``ForeignKey`` relation to ``User`` model. In
  case if we want to order by ``email`` field in the ``ProfileViewSet``,
  instead of ordering on ``user__email`` we could order just on ``email``.
